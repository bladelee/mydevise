              <h3><p>Who is DigitalOcean for?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>DigitalOcean is a platform created for 
developers who need to launch and scale their applications quickly. 
Additionally, DigitalOcean provides the perfect environment for 
developers to play around on the command line and learn more about 
customizing their own servers.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do you have a referral program?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Yes we do! Customers can refer their friends and earn $25 in account credits or payout. <a href="https://digitalocean.com/help/referral-program/">Click here</a> to learn more about how our referral program works.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What are DigitalOcean's key advantages?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>DigitalOcean is a simple and fast cloud hosting 
provider built for developers. Customers can create a cloud server in 55
 seconds, and pricing plans start at only $5 per month for 512MB of RAM,
 20GB SSD, 1 CPU, and 1TB Transfer.</p>

<p>The DigitalOcean control panel interface is simple and intuitive, 
which power users can replicate on a larger scale with the company’s 
API. DigitalOcean uses KVM virtualization and additionally <a href="https://digitalocean.com/community/">hosts a library of helpful walkthroughs and tutorials</a> that cover server configuration and optimization.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What advantages does an SSD cloud server have over a shared hosting plan?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>DigitalOcean users can have their personal cloud
 server spun up and active in 55 seconds. Each box comes with full root 
access, a choice of Linux distributions, and the ability to customize 
the setup.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What advantages does an SSD cloud server have over a dedicated server?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>DigitalOcean allows on the fly scaling—a task 
that is much more difficult on a dedicated box. Changing the amount of 
RAM on a box can be done with a simple reboot, while expanding the disk 
size takes less than an hour. The same process can take hours or days 
with a dedicated setup.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>The prices are awesomely low! Does DigitalOcean make a profit?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We are able to make enough profit to keep the lights on :)</p>
<p></p>

            <h2 id="">Policy Questions</h2>
              <h3><p>What is your SLA?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Digital Ocean provides a 99.99% Uptime SLA. Lost time is refunded back to your account at the hourly rate incurred.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do you allow TOR exit nodes?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Although we do not specifically disallow TOR 
exit nodes, as the account holder you are responsible for all the 
traffic going through your droplet (including traffic that an exit node 
may generate). All violations of our Terms of Service must be addressed 
as soon as possible after any issue is emailed to you.</p>

<p>Also be aware that we do not allow some of the traffic types that 
come out of a typical TOR exit node (torrents, spam, ssh probes, hacking
 attempts, botnets, ddos, etc).</p>

<p>If you are unable to stop this sort of traffic, please reconsider 
running a TOR exit node as it may lead to your account suspension or 
termination.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Where are your datacenters located?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We have datacenters located in the NYC area 
(located in the Equinix and Telx datacenters), San Francisco (Telx), 
Singapore (Equinix), and in Amsterdam (TelecityGroup). We have multiple 
private peering uplink providers including Level3, NTT, nLayer, Tinet, 
TATA, and Telia. We are directly peered to hundreds of other providers 
on public exchange points.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Are your datacenters certified / PCI compliant?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>All of our datacenters have been certified by national and/or international security standards.</p>

<ul>
<li>Our NYC1 facility is SSAE16 SOC-1 Type II certified.</li>
<li>Our AMS1 and AMS2 facilities are ISO27001:2005 and ISO9001 certified.</li>
<li>Our SFO1 facility is SSAE16 SOC-1 Type II certified.</li>
<li>Our NYC2 facility is SSAE16 SOC-2 Type II certified.</li>
<li>Our SGP1 facility is ISO27001:2005 certified.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do you charge for bandwidth?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Yes. Plans start with 1TB per month and increase
 incrementally. Once the monthly transfer limit has been exceeded, the 
cost of bandwidth is $0.02 per GB over the limit.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do you have a speed test?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Below are links to speed tests of our NYC and AMS and SFO network:</p>

<ul>

<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do you offer managed hosting?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>No. DigitalOcean is completely unmanaged — if 
you experience issues with your server, you can reach to support via a 
ticket. However, for server setup questions and specific details on 
debugging server software, we recommend reaching out on our <a href="https://digitalocean.com/community/questions">community forum</a> or IRC channel.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What is your policy on TOR?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You will be responsible for the sub-users that 
connect to your TOR service. If there is abuse that is a result of your 
sub-users, we do not have a way to tell the difference, so it will be as
 if your account was abusive. This will get flagged by our backend and 
lead to your account being suspended and virtual servers destroyed. </p>

<p>We do not recommend running open services where any user can connect 
and possibly be abusive, as it will all fall under your account and can 
lead to service interruptions for you. </p>

<p>We also do not restrict the installation of software, but you are 
responsible for how it is used and how freely available you make the 
service."</p>

            <h2 id="">Billing Questions</h2>
              <h3><p>How do I choose between monthly and hourly billing?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Each Droplet is billed per hour up to its 
monthly cap. The monthly cost of your Droplet is calculated by running 
the hourly rate for 28 days (672 hours). Once you reach that amount 
(e.g. $10/mo for a 1GB VPS), you will not be charged for your server's 
additional runtime. This allows you to destroy your server before the 
maximum monthly charge and pay only for what you use.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Am I charged when I enter a credit card?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>No — when you enter a card, we only run an 
authorization charge of $1.23. This authorization is refunded back to 
your card by your bank in no more than 30 days. Your card is charged at 
the end of the monthly billing cycle.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How do I apply a promo code?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>As a new customer you can easily apply a promo code to your account from the Payment Methods page <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/user_payment_profiles">here</a>.
 Enter the case sensitive code in the promo code field. Once entered 
correctly, the credits will automatically apply to your account. In 
order to spin up your first droplet you must also have a valid credit 
card on your account or make a PayPal deposit. Keep in mind that we only
 allow one promo code per account, so if you’ve redeemed one in the past
 you may not add another. To see your promo code history please visit 
your <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/billing">billing page</a>.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How am I billed?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Each droplet is billed per hour up to its 
monthly cap. You can choose to fund your account via PayPal or you can 
pay your monthly bill via credit card.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do you accept virtual, electron, debit or prepaid credit cards?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience, but because 
we receive a large amount of fraudulent sign-ups we’ve had to restrict 
the use of virtual/electron and debit cards in some geographies. We made
 this decision after finding that up to 80% of abusive sign-ups used 
these types of cards. If you would like to pay with one of these cards, 
we recommend using the card to send a payment via PayPal.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>My credit card expired or was declined and the payment failed. How do I fix it to prevent my account from being suspended?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You can resolve this issue by adding a new 
credit card to your account, or by making a deposit via PayPal. As we do
 not allow credit cards to be edited, you will need to delete the old 
credit card and add a new one. Our billing system will also send you 
payment reminders before any actions such as service suspension are 
taken on your account.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do you offer refunds?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>No, we do not offer refunds. If there are extenuating circumstances, please <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/support">open up a ticket</a> with our support team.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What form of payments do you accept?</p>

              <p></p><p>We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and PayPal.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Can I pay in advance?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We do not currently accept pre-payment, but you 
can add additional credit to your account at anytime by sending in a 
PayPal payment.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How am I charged if I have both PayPal and a credit card on file?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>At the end of the month, if there is a balance 
on your account, our billing system will attempt to charge any credit 
cards that you have on file on the 1st of the month. If you’d like to 
use PayPal instead, please make sure your account has enough credit at 
all times to cover your monthly billings.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Can I transfer credits from one account to another?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>No - credits cannot be transferred between accounts.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do I have to pay the cost of the server every time I create a new one?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>No — you only need to pay for 1 hour of usage. 
Spinning up a new 512MB server just to test something for a couple of 
minutes will only cost you $0.007</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Can you charge my card on a specific date?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We automatically attempt to charge your credit card on the 1st of each month. After you become a <a href="https://digitalocean.com/help/account">verified customer</a>,
 you can go to the billing page and pay your outstanding balance at any 
time by clicking the “Pay now” button that appears underneath your 
balance.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>If I have multiple credit cards on file, which one do you charge?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Our billing system will attempt to charge your 
cards starting with the most recently added card. If there is a specific
 card you'd like to use for payment, please make sure it is the most 
recently added card or delete any other cards from your account.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>I submitted a PayPal payment. Why hasn't my balance been updated?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Balances are not updated in real time. Once you 
submit your PayPal payment it gets processed and added to our system. 
You should see the updated balance in a few hours.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Am I charged while my droplet is in a powered-off state?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Yes. Your diskspace, CPU, RAM, and IP address 
are all reserved while your droplet is powered off. If you want to save a
 droplet for future use take a snapshot of it and then destroy it. 
You'll be able to create a new droplet from the snapshot image anytime 
to bring it back online.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>When do you charge my credit card?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We charge your credit card on the 1st day of each month after usage.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>I have a credit, why can’t I create a droplet?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>In order to use the credit you’ll need to 
activate your account by adding a valid credit card to your account or 
prepay via PayPal.</p>

</h3>
              <p></p><p>For security purposes we never resend your 
password. If you have forgotten it simply navigate to the login page and
 click on the “Forgot Password” link. We’ll then send you an email with 
instructions on how to reset your password.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How can I increase my droplet limit?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You can easily raise your droplet limit by opening up a <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/support">support ticket</a> with our team. After review, we’ll be able to update your limit.</p>

              <h3><p>Why didn't I receive a root password via Email?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Please check your spam folder in case the email 
was mis-delivered. You can also reset your Droplet's root password by 
click on "Access" and then "Password Reset". Alternatively, instead of 
using a password, you can set up SSH keys for your server which would 
eliminate the need for a password altogether. You can find more 
information <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-digitalocean-droplets">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Why are root passwords emailed?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>The root password is sent via email because it is the easiest and fastest way to get a user online and running a virtual server.</p>

<p>Upon logging in for the first time with the root password we require 
that the password be changed. We strongly recommend updating to a strong
  password. Here are a few guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a password that has eight or more characters. The longer the password the better.</li>
<li>Use a string of random words.</li>
<li>Add numbers and/or punctuation to your password.</li>
<li>Mix upper and lowercase</li>
<li>Use different passwords for different servers</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can use SSH keys to access the server. You can add
 SSH-keys to the control panel and then deploy new servers with the SSH 
key installed under the root user.</p>

<p>See this community article: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-digitalocean-droplets">How to Use SSH Keys with DigitalOcean Droplets</a></p>

<p>When using SSH-keys, no root password is set.</p>

<p>We also recommend updating the ssh config when using SSH keys to only
 allow SSH logins via root with the following config update:
PermitRootLogin without-password</p>

              <h3><p>How do I cancel my account?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You can cancel your account anytime through the 
control panel, under the settings tab. First, destroy any droplets 
active on your account, resolve any outstanding billing and then click 
“Deactivate Account.”</p>

            <h2 id="">Referral Program Questions</h2>
              <h3><p>How do I earn the account credit?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Account credit is earned within 30 days after 
your friend has totaled $25 in billings. There is no limit to how much 
you can earn.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>When do I receive my account credit?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You will receive your account credits after your
 referral completes $25 of billing. This typically occurs no later than 
the 15th of the month.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What is a pending referral?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>A pending referral means that a user has signed 
up with your link, but has not yet met the spending threshold for the 
payout to occur.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How do I get started?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Customers will be provided with a referral code 
link that can be utilized for endorsing our services while tracking 
referrals and commissions. The referral code link can be accessed from 
the Settings Page within the DigitalOcean control panel.</p>
<p></p>

            <h2 id="">Technical   General Questions</h2>
              <h3><p>Do you host DNS?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Yes — you can set up your site using our domain manager. See <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean">this community article</a> for more details.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What kind of Network does DigitalOcean run on?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>All DigitalOcean physical nodes are connected 
via gigabit ethernet to switches, which are uplinked to our aggregators 
and core routers. All core routers are uplinked via 10-gigE uplinks to 
providers.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do you offer backups?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>DigitalOcean offers two kinds of backups: 
snapshots and backups. Snapshots can be done at any time, while 
automated backups runs every couple of days.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What kind of Virtualization do you use?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We use KVM.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What type of filesystem formats do you use?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We are using LVM and QCOW in all datacenters except for Singapore 1, which uses RAW.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What is a droplet?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>DigitalOcean calls its virtual servers, droplets; each droplet that you spin up is a new virtual server for your personal use.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do you provide console access?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We provide console access via VNC through our control panel.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What is the CPU speed of my droplet?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We use server-grade Intel Hexcore processors 
between 2.0 GHz and 3.0 GHz. To view the clock speed and other details 
of the CPU on the hypervisor you are assigned, run this command on the 
command line: cat /proc/cpuinfo</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do you have a default firewall enabled?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>No — but we encourage our users to enable one once their droplet is setup.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do you offer Windows servers?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We do not provide Windows-based servers.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Can I get a custom plan of CPU, RAM, or Disk / just increase SSD space?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We do not currently support the ability to 
create custom plans where resources can be increased independently. This
 means we cannot currently add additional SSD / disk space capacity to a
 plan.</p>

<p>The sizes that we provide logically bring resources together and 
allow us to most effectively distribute virtual machines across the 
backend (as well as deliver the most competitive price to our 
customers).</p>

<p>The sizes available are found on our <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing">Pricing page</a>.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Do you have an API?</p>

              <h3><p>How do I set up Two-Factor Authentication on my DigitalOcean account?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>To begin with Two-Factor Authentication, you 
will need to download the Google Authenticator app for your mobile 
phone. Your phone will have to have the correct date, time, and timezone
 to work correctly.</p>

<p>Log into your DigitalOcean account and click the "gear" icon in the navigation to open the <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings">settings page</a>. Click the green 'Enable 2-factor authentication' button.</p>

<p>On this page, select your phone number's country, and fill in your phone number. Then click the blue submit button.</p>

<p>You should get a text message from Google on that number. Put the 
code from that text into the 'enter pin' box and click the blue submit 
button. Then you will be presented with a QR code.</p>

<p>On your mobile device, load the Google Authenticator app and add a 
new account. There is no need to enter any information, just manually 
add a new account with the 'scan a barcode' feature. Hold your phone's 
camera up to your computer screen to capture an image of the QR Code.</p>

<p>A code will then be displayed on your screen. The code is time 
sensitive; take that 6-digit code and enter it into our website in the 
'Enter pin' box and then click the blue "Submit" button. That's all that
 you should need to enable Two Factor Authentication.</p>

<p>If you have any problems, please make sure that your phone is set to 
the correct date, time, and time zone. If that's not the issue, <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/support">open a ticket</a> and let us know exactly at what step you are having trouble and we'll work together to resolve it.</p>

              <h3><p>Do you support adding multiple IPs per virtual server? How can I get an additional IP?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We do not currently provide the ability to add 
more than one public IPv4 IP address per virtual server. This is due to 
the worldwide limited availability of remaining IPv4 address space. We 
are working on implementing IPv6 as soon as we can, and we’ll be sure to

              <h3><p>Why is the GeoIP information for my droplet wrong?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>The GeoLocation of all IPs are handled by 
different governing bodies that issue those IPs for use by ISPs. A 
mismatch can happen between the time we receive a new IP block and the 
time the organizations responsible for updating the geography of IPs 
updates their databases. </p>

<p>As these organizations move at their own pace, we have little 
influence over the speed at which they make geographic changes when IP 
blocks are reallocated between organizations. If there is a discrepancy 
it usually means that it is a new assignment and will soon be updated. </p>

              <h3><p>Is GRUB supported?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Grub is not supported. The kernel and initrd are
 specified by the hypervisor upon boot. We are currently working on a

              <h3><p>How can I change my IP address?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You can use the following procedure to get a new IP address for your droplet:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a snapshot image of your droplet from the control panel.</li>
<li>Create a new droplet from your snapshot.</li>
<li>Destroy your original droplet.</li>
</ol>

              <h3><p>How are PTR and Reverse DNS records configured?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>rDNS/PTR records are automatically configured for your IPs based on the hostname that you provide for your droplet.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How can I access MySQL from a remote computer?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>If you are connecting to MySQL remotely, you 
will have to enable MySQL to listen on the public interface of your 
droplet as well as the loopback.</p>

<p>Typically, this is done in "/etc/mysql/my.cnf" by changing the line "bind<em>address=127.0.0.1" to "bind</em>address=0.0.0.0"</p>

<p>However, please note that this will allow anyone to connect to your 
MySQL server, so you should make sure that you have secure passwords on 
all accounts and consider creating firewall rules to prevent unwanted 
connections.</p>

<p>Here is a community question that may be of further help: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-allow-remote-mysql-database-connection">How to Allow Remote MySQL Database Connection</a></p>

              <h3><p>Why is my domain not resolving?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>DNS can take time to propagate. Also, your local
 nameserver will cache results; therefore, you must flush your local 
nameserver cache in order to effectively debug DNS updates. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the command line tool 'dig' to check the updates. </p>

<p>For information on how to debug DNS, see this article: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean">How to Set Up a Host Name with DigitalOcean</a></p>

              <h3><p>Is my VPS IP address static?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>A virtual server's IP address is static and 
reserved for your virtual machine until you destroy it. Rebuilding a 
virtual server retains the same IP that you had initially.</p>

<p>Additionally, our backend will automatically attempt to return an IP 
address that you have used in the past. Therefore, if you destroy a 
server and process a create soon after, you will most likely receive the
 same IP address (although this is not guaranteed).</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How do I set an rDNS (reverse DNS) or PTR (pointer) Record?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>The rDNS for your droplet's IP is automatically set to the hostname of your droplet as it appears in the control panel.</p>

<p>If you wish to update your rDNS (PTR record) simply rename your droplet in the control panel:</p>

<ol>
<li>Navigate to the droplet listing.</li>
<li>Select the droplet to rename.</li>
<li>Choose the "Settings" tab followed by the "Rename" option.</li>
<li>Fill out the "New Hostname" field then click the "Rename" button.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Why does my MySQL daemon crash?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>The most common reason why MySQL is not running is that it stopped or failed to start as a result of not enough memory.</p>

<p>This can usually be seen by attempting to start the mysql server 
("service mysql start" on Ubuntu and some other systems) and then 
reviewing the mysql error log (usually in /var/log/mysql/error.log or 
similar file path).</p>

<p>A useful program to review the logs one page at a time is "less" – for example: less /var/log/mysql/error.log</p>

<p>If you see memory issues such as "mmap can't allocate" then you can be sure that you are having memory issues.</p>

<p>Potential solutions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Upsize to a larger server. We recommend at least a 1GB droplet for any server utilizing a MySQL database.</li>

              <h3><p>How can I move my virtual server or make my snapshot available in another datacenter?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You can transfer a snapshot of your Droplet to another datacenter and spin up a new VPS from that image.</p>

<p>You will want to follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put your droplet in an off state by running the command "sudo shutdown -h now"</li>
<li>Go to Snapshots &gt; enter your snapshot name &gt; Take Snapshot</li>
<li>Once the snapshot has been taken, go to Images &gt; click on the 
globe icon (on the same line as the name of your snapshot), and select 
the region/datacenter you'd like to transfer to.</li>
<li>Now you will be able to create a new Droplet using this snapshot that was just transferred to the region/datacenter.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>There are no sizes available for FastResize. How can I resize?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>FastResize is limited to the resources available on the physical hypervisor your server is on.</p>

<p>If there are no resources available, no sizes will be listed on the FastResize Page.</p>

<p>If this is the case, you will need to take the slower method of 
snapshot &amp; redeployment which is not limited to the same hypervisor:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a snapshot </li>
<li>Destroy your old droplet (this releases the IP) </li>
<li>Immediately after the delete is finished, create a new droplet, 
choose the same datacenter, and in the "select images" section switch to
 "my images" and select your snapshot. This server will almost always 
capture the IP just released.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How do I start over with a fresh installation?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>To restart your droplet with a different 
operating system, or perform a fresh installation of your current one, 
follow these easy steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Login to the control panel, navigate to your list of droplets, and select the one you wish to destroy or re-deploy.</li>
<li>Click "Destroy" then "Rebuild" and choose the appropriate operating system from the "Select an Image" menu. </li>
<li>Finally, click the blue "Rebuild From Image" button.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>IMPORTANT: All data on your droplet will be destroyed when it is 
rebuilt. Remember to backup your data or take snapshots of your work in 
order to preserve that image. </li>
</ul>

<p>Your IP will be preserved.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How can I ensure my droplets get put on separate hypervisors?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We do not have the ability for customers to 
select which hypervisors they are distributed to at the moment. However,
 if you spin up droplets and provide us with the names of the droplets, 
we are able to look these up to find out if any of your droplets have 
landed on the same hypervisor.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How do I change the kernel of my droplet?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>To change a kernel of a droplet, you must use the control panel or the API. </p>

<p>In the control panel:</p>

<ul>
<li>Navigate to your droplet listing</li>
<li>Choose the droplet </li>
<li>Select the "Settings" tab and the "Kernel" option</li>
<li>Note your existing kernel then select a new kernel</li>
<li>Click on the blue "Change" button</li>
<li>Shut down your droplet gracefully by using the command "poweroff" in a terminal window with root privileges</li>
<li>Using the control panel turn on your droplet</li>
<li>Make sure the droplet boots. If not, go back to the previous kernel 
and poweroff/power on as above to restore your previous setting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional notes:</p>

<p>Using a 32 bit kernel with a 64bit OS, or a 64bit kernel with a 32bit kernel, or a kernel from another OS is not supported.</p>

<p>Changing a kernel will not change or update your OS.</p>

<p>If your desired kernel is not listed, please add it as a suggestion on our <a href="http://digitalocean.uservoice.com/forums/136585-digital-ocean">user voice forum</a> stating the linux distribution, the version requested, and the feature it has that you are in need of.</p>

<p>The "DO-recovery" kernels are intended for use after instructed in a Support Ticket.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How can I transfer a droplet or snapshot to another user or account?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>We are unable to transfer droplets between 
accounts, but we can transfer snapshots. This would allow you to 
recreate the server in another account with the only difference being 
the IP address.</p>

<p>To transfer a snapshot to another user, here are the steps to take: </p>

<ul>
<li>From the control panel select Images. Select the Transfer Snapshot icon and enter the email address of the recipient</li>
<li>Upon clicking the transfer button, the sender will notice their icon
 turns blue, indicating that the snapshot transfer is pending. When the 
recipient accepts the transfer the sender will no longer have access to 
the image </li>
<li>The recipient will have a new section on the Images page titled 
Pending Snapshot Transfer Requests. Here you'll be able to accept or 
decline the transfer request. If approved, the snapshot will disappear 
from the sender's account, and will be added to your list of Snapshots 
where you'll have full control over the image</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How do I safely power cycle (reboot) my server?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Rebooting your virtual server is a simple two-step process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Login to your droplet as root and execute the "poweroff" or 
"shutdown -h now" command. This will shut down your operating system, 
flush any pending changes to the disk, and then terminate power to your 
server.</li>
<li>Visit the control panel and select the option to power on your droplet.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>IMPORTANT: Using the "power off" switch in the control panel to shut
 down your VPS is similar to pulling the plug on a running computer and 
may lead to drive corruption [as the disk cache is not able to be 
properly flushed].</li>
</ul>

<p>It is recommended that you connect to the console after booting in case the boot process fails. For any issues, please <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/support">open a support ticket</a> and we'll be happy to assist you any way we can.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Why did changing my kernel not change my operating system?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>A kernel and an operating system, while linked, are actually two separate things.</p>

<p>The Kernel is the link between software and hardware, and the 
Operating system are the set of software that create the interactive 
environment in which you operate. </p>

<p>Changing a kernel will not change your operating system - and if you 
change the kernel to something that doesn't match your operating system,
 it will quite possibly break your system.</p>

<p>There is no practical way to change your operating system of a running computer and keep your files intact. </p>

<p>You could create a new server entirely, and use a utility like 'rsync' to copy over relevant data from one server to another. </p>

<p>However, if your data on your server isn't important, or you've 
already backed it up somewhere accessible, you could rebuild your server
 from a new image by doing the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Log into the control panel</li>
<li>Click the droplet</li>
<li>Select the destroy tab</li>
<li>Use the "Rebuild" option, and select the image you want to boot from (ex: a CentOS one) </li>
<li>Click "rebuild from image"</li>
</ul>

<p>This will wipe out your existing file system and install a new image and kernel.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What is my droplet limit? How do I raise it?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You can view your Droplet limit in the control 
panel by navigating over to the settings section accessible via the gear
 icon in the lower left corner of the control panel. </p>

<p>We employ Droplet limits to help us curb abuse and fraud in the cloud. You can increase your limit at anytime by <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/support">opening a support ticket</a> and after review, we'll be happy to increase your limit.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>What is the difference between Fast-Resize and Migrate-Resize?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Fast resize increases or decreases your CPU and 
RAM according to the new plan selected [but does not resize the disk]. 
The benefit is the resize is processed with a simple reboot: shutdown 
your server from the command line, select the new size, and then click 
"Boot" from the control panel.</p>

<p>The migrate-resize will move your virtual machine to another 
hypervisor and also resize the disk in the process. This process is 
longer and can take up to 35-40 minutes, depending on the size of your 
virtual server and how much diskspace is being utilized. </p>

<p>For more information, see this tutorial: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-resize-droplets-using-snapshots">How to Resize Droplets Using Snapshots</a></p>

<p>Please note that once you resize to a larger disk, you will no longer
 be able to select a smaller plan for a fast-resize. This is because 
there will be a disk mismatch and we do not currently support shrinking a
 virtual server's disk.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How can I rename my droplet?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>To rename your droplet, follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log into <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/">your account</a></li>
<li>Click the name of the droplet you wish to rename</li>
<li>Click "Settings"</li>
<li>Click "Rename"</li>
<li>Where it says "New Hostname," click and type a Fully Qualified Hostname</li>
<li>Click the blue "Rename" button</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Why did FastResize not change my disk size?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>To make the process fast, the "FastResize" does not change disk size, only RAM and CPU, as it performs a simple reboot.</p>

<p>If you need to change disk size, use the following procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a snapshot</li>
<li>Destroy your old droplet (this releases the IP) </li>
<li>Immediately after the delete is finished, create a new droplet of 
the desired size using the snapshot as the starting image, and choose 
the same datacenter. This server will almost always capture the IP just 
released</li>

              <h3><p>How can I enable backups on my existing droplet?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>At the moment, you can only enable backups when creating a new server.</p>

<p>To enable automatic backups on an existing server, you'll need to follow these instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a snapshot of your server</li>
<li>Delete your server to release the IP</li>
<li>Immediately after the delete is finished, create a new droplet, 
choose the same datacenter, and in the "select images" section switch to
 "my images" and select your snapshot. Then check the "Enable Backups" 
box. This server will almost always capture the IP just released.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How can I recover from an unbootable droplet?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You have two options:
1. Attempt Recovery with Fsck Kernel
2. Attempt Recovery with a Recovery ISO</p>

<p>Read about it here: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-recover-from-file-system-corruption-using-fsck-and-a-recovery-iso">How to Recover from File System Corruption Using Fsck and a Recovery ISO</a></p>

<p>Please <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/support">let us know</a> if you need to have the ArchISO set as the boot device on your droplet.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How much do you charge for backups?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>The pricing for backups is 20% of the droplet; 
so for a $5 droplet - backup is $1 per month.  For a $20 droplet - 
backup is $4 per month.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How do I add swap to prevent resource crashes?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>By default the virtual server is not configured 
with swap since it degrades the Solid State Drives, which can 
occasionally cause a process to be killed. </p>

<p>To correct this issue, you can add swap by following this guide: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-configure-virtual-memory-swap-file-on-a-vps">How to Configure Virtual Memory Swap File on a VPS</a></p>

<p>If that doesn't help, you may want to consider resizing to a larger 
droplet and see if that prevents your virtual server or process from 
crashing.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How can I download a backup?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Unfortunately you are unable to store a snapshot or backup outside of our environment. </p>

<p>If you are wanting to backup your data, we recommend taking a look at these community articles:</p>

<p></p>
              <h3><p>How can I repair my filesystem?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You can repair your filesystem using the following process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Power off your droplet and change your kernel to the DO-recovery-static-fsck image.</li>
<li>Boot your droplet and access it via the console in the control panel.</li>
<li>Run the command "fsck /dev/vda"</li>
<li>Answer yes to any requests to repair errors</li>
<li>Power off your droplet, change the kernel back to the original, and reboot</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How can I re-deploy my server?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You can re-deploy your droplet while maintaining the same IP using the following method:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create snapshot</li>
<li>Delete server to release IP</li>
<li>Create new server of the desired size in the same datacenter. In the
 "select images" section switch to "my images" and select your snapshot.
 </li>
</ol>

<p>Once you submit this form, the server captures the IP just released.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How can I rebuild my droplet?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You can most definitely rebuild your current 
droplet. In the control panel you can use the following process to 
rebuild your droplet:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on your droplet</li>
<li>Click on the destroy tab</li>
<li>Click on the "Rebuild" sub-tab</li>
<li>Either click "rebuild from original" or select a different OS image to use and click "Rebuild from image"</li>
</ol>

            <h2 id="">I Pv6 Questions</h2>
              <h3><p>How many IP address get allocated to each IPv6 droplet?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Each droplet is allocated 16 IPv6 addresses. You
 can read more about how to enable the IP addresses on your server here:
 
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-additional-ipv6-addresses-to-your-droplet</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>I set up IPv6. Why isn’t it working?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>This is most likely due to your internet service
 provider not supporting IPv6. In order for IPv6 to work, it needs to be
 available on both sides. Both the droplet and the computer you are 
trying to access it from must have support for it. In order to check if 
IPv6 is working on your end, please visit: http://ipv6-test.com/</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>I don’t have IPv6 at home, how can I test it out?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You can test the IPv6 connection from within 
your droplet by logging into your server and trying to reach the Google 
IPv6 name server with the following command: ping6 2001:4860:4860::8888 </p>

<p>If this is successful, it means that your IPv6 is configured 
correctly. It will be able to communicate with other sites and servers 
that have IPv6 enabled throughout the internet. You can also connect to 
your server through an IPv6 tunnel. </p>

<p>DigitalOcean is directly peered with Hurricane electric for best IPv6 over tunnel performance: https://tunnelbroker.net</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>Are there any security implications associated with enabling IPv6 on a droplet?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>In Linux, IPv6 security is maintained separately
 from IPv4. For example, iptables only maintains firewall rules for IPv4
 addresses but it has an IPv6 counterpart called ip6tables, which can be
 used to maintain firewall rules for IPv6 network addresses.  If your 
VPS is configured for IPv6, please remember to secure both your IPv4 and
 IPv6 network interfaces with the appropriate tools. For more 
information about IPv6 tools, refer to this guide:

              <h3><p>How do I set up DNS for my IPv6 address?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>You can set up the DNS for the IPv6 address by 
using the AAAA record. You can find more information about setting it up
 here:   
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean</p>

              <h3><p>Can I get IPv6 in NYC? AMS? SFO?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>At this time, IPv6 is only available in the 
Singapore datacenter. There are plans to expand IPv6 to other 
datacenters in the future, and it will be a standard feature for all new
 datacenter locations going forward.</p>
<p></p>
              <h3><p>How do I request more IPv6 addresses?</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>At this time, we are allocating 16 addresses to 
each droplet. In the future, we may consider raising the amount. To 
provide feedback and request more IP addresses, please let us know your

              <h3><p>Get Familiar with DNS</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>DNS, or the Domain Name System, is an integral 
part of how the internet functions today. However, the way that DNS 
works is often quite mysterious for new administrators. In this guide, 
we discuss some of the common terminology and concepts that are involved
 in DNS configuration. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts">Read More</a></p>

              <h3><p>View and Configure Linux Logs</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Linux and the applications that run on it can 
generate all different types of messages, which are recorded in various 
log files. Linux uses a set of configuration files, directories, 
programs, commands and daemons to create, store and recycle these log 
messages. Knowing where the system keeps its log files and how to make 
use of related commands can therefore help save valuable time during 
troubleshooting. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-view-and-configure-linux-logs-on-ubuntu-and-centos">Read More</a></p>

              <h3><p>Create an SSL Certificate for your site</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>This tutorial explains how to create a 
self-signed SSL certificate, how to add it to your server, and how to 
configure the SSL file to display the certificate to the world. An SSL 
certificate is a way to encrypt a site's information and create a more 
secure connection. Certificate Authorities can issue SSL certificates 
that verify the server's details, while a self-signed certificate has no
 3rd party corroboration. This tutorial is written for Apache on an 
Ubuntu server. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-create-a-ssl-certificate-on-apache-for-ubuntu-12-04">Read More</a></p>

              <h3><p>Learn More About Git</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>Git is a very useful piece of software to help 
streamline development for programming projects. It comes with no 
language or file structure requirements, leaving it open for developers 
to decide how they want to structure their workflow. This tutorial 
covers creating your git workspace and pushing your changes. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-use-git-effectively">Read More</a></p>

              <h3><p>Set Up IP Tables</p>
</h3>
              <p></p><p>This tutorial covers setting up a very simple 
firewall with IP Tables on an Ubuntu Droplet. The IP table rules come 
from a series of options that can be combined to create each specific 
process. Each packet that crosses the firewall is checked by each rule 
in order. As soon as it matches a rule, the packet follows the 
associated action; otherwise, it proceeds down the line. You should be 
able to copy and paste many of the rules in the article. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-using-ip-tables-on-ubuntu-12-04">Read More</a></p>

many people like to customize is their Bash prompt. In this article, we 
discuss how you can personalize and add color to your Bash prompt so 
that the information you need is always available. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-customize-your-bash-prompt-on-a-linux-vps">Read More</a></p>
